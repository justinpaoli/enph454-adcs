ADCS TESTING GIMBAL

This directory holds iterations on the design for the ADCS 'one-U' testing bed

All designs are uploaded as stl files. Github has issues with SolidWorks files. If SolidWorks files are needed check the [cad](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/cad.git) repo, or contact the designer.

All documentation should be in the [documentation](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/documentation/tree/master/adcs) repo, with design goals and updates stored as issues and commits in this repo.
