# Attitude Determination and Control System
### Requirements
The rules of the CSDC 2018-2020 competition season state the ADCS must satisfy 
the following requiments:
* ***CSDC-0270 Co-ordinate System for Selfie-Cam Operations***
    The co-ordinate system for the Selfie-Cam operations shall have the 
    Z+ axis towards geodetic nadir, the X+ axis in the orbital velocity
    direction, and the Y+ axis completing the right-hand system.
* ***CSDC-0280 Attitude Extent for Selfie-Cam Operations***
    The Space-Selfie camera shall be able to be pointed up to 25 degrees
    off-nadir in the roll axis; the nominal pitch and yaw for Selfie-Cam
    operations shall be zero degrees.
* ***CSDC-0290 Attitude Control***
    The spacecraft attitude shall be controlled (3 sigma) to an angle no
    greater than one-quarter of the Space Selfie camera's along-track and
    across-track field of view angles.
* ***CSDC-0300 Attitude Determination Fault-Tolerance***
    The Attitude Determination subsystem shall be designed so that it is
    tolerant to at least one attitude sensor failure, and will maintain at
    least a degraded state of performance.
* ***CSDC-0310 Attitude Control Fault-Tolerance***
    The Attitude Control subsystem shall be designed so that it is fault
    tolerant to at least one actuator failure, and will maintain at least
    a degraded state of performance.
