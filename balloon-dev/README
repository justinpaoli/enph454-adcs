This folder contains code and documentation for ADCS portion of stratospheric balloon payload, goals include:
1. Running microcontrollers in an RTOS environment
2. Running dependable two-way serial communication between both arduinos and main OBC
3. Quickly reading telemetry from sensor suite via I2C bus
4. Quickly writing telemetry to onboard SD card
5. Returning telemetry to main OBC for relay to comms system
6. Responding to commands from OBC
	a. This mainly pertains to the activaton and deactivation of reaction wheel control mechanisms
7. Have reaction wheel system kill rotational velocity in one dimension
8. Have reaction wheel system control large to small angle orientation of payload
